    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Whenever you make these cookies for someone, be sure to bring along several copies of the recipe! You will be asked for it, I promise! NOTE: I make icing with confectioners' sugar and milk. I make it fairly thin, as I 'paint' the icing on the cookies with a pastry brush. Thin enough to spread easily but not so thin that it just makes your cookies wet and runs off.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Butter - </strong>Use unsalted butter that's just soft enough to be pliable, but not warm enough to be greasy. If you press your fingertip into the butter it should leave a slight indentation, but should not be soft and mushy.</li>
            <li><strong>Sugar - </strong>Simply spoon white granulated sugar into your measuring cup and level it off with the flat edge of a knife, spatula, or bench scraper.</li>
            <li><strong>Eggs</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Vanilla extract - </strong>For the best flavor, use real vanilla extract instead of imitation vanilla.</li>
            <li><strong>Flour - </strong>Use all-purpose flour. To measure flour, fluff it up with a spoon in the bag or container, then use the spoon to scoop it into the measuring cup and level it off. Don't pack the flour into the measuring cup or the ingredient ratio will be off and your cookies may turn out too dry and crumbly.</li>
            <li><strong>Baking poweder - </strong>Baking powder is a leavening agent and helps the cookie dough rise while baking.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt - </strong>Use regular table salt for this recipe.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Steps!</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Cream together butter and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth. Beat in eggs and vanilla. Stir in flour, baking powder, and salt. Cover, and chill dough for at least 1 hour (or overnight).</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Lightly dust a work surface with flour. Roll out dough to 1/4 to 1/2 inch thickness. Cut into shapes with any cookie cutter. Place cookies 1 inch apart on ungreased baking sheets.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are lightly browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Carefully transfer cookies to a wire rack and cool completely before decorating.</li>
        </ol>
